# Simple Raft

A simple raft implementation written to test how raft works
- [hasicorp-raft](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft) based raft implementation
- [badger](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) based persistence layer
- [gofiber](https://gofiber.io/) based api interface 

future plan is to build a raft kv database implementation from scratch without using third party packages.
